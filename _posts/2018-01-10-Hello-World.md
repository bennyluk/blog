### Wait… let me enjoy that feeling. Sighhh. It’s done.

I can’t even count the number of times I have told myself, “Benny, finish the blog and move on with your life”.

### We Can’t Help Everyone, But Everyone Can Help Someone

Let’s be honest, I aint no god-sent programmer like Bill Gates, hacker like GeoHotz, or an activist like Aaron Swartz. I’m just an average joe that learns programming by looking at code in GitHub and experimenting.

This is pretty much my daily routine in my workplace, and I’m thankful that the software development community is open-minded (and open sourced). So here is for you community. <beer>.
